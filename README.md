This is sq, a 7x15 pixel font inspired by Codec and Quadraat Sans Mono.

I have been playing around with Chris Cannam's [Codec][1] font, when I
noticed it looked rather similar to FF Quadraat Sans Mono, which I
always wanted to use as a console font, at least since Octoploid made
this [awesome screenshot][2].  But I never was confident with the
outline font at low size, and I dislike the look of anti-aliasing.

I thus decided to redraw Codec with great influence of Quadraat and
created a new, crisp 7x15 .bdf font called "sq".  Since urxvt has
problems with emboldening, I also made a bold version and manually
revised the characters.  The font has the full latin1 range.

This font is in the public domain.
